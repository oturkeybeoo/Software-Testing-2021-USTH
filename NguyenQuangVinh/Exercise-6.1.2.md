## A tester defined three characteristics based on the input parameter car: Where Made, Energy Source, and Size. The following partitionings for these characteristics have at least two mistakes. Correct them.
                                                                                    |
    | Characteristic    | Block 1           | Block 2           | Block 3           |
    | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
    | Where Made        | North American    | Europe            | Asia              |
    | Energy Source     | Gas               | Electric          | Hybrid            |
    | Size              | 2-door            | 4-door            | hatchback         |

    Firstly, all 3 characteristic do not cover the whole domain (not satisfy completeness)
    Secondly, Hybrid can be Gas and Electric and a 2-door or 4-door car can have hatchback, which make them overlap (not satisfy disjoint)
