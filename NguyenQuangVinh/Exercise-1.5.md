## Below are four faulty programs. Each includes test inputs that result in failure. Answer the following questions about each program

#### (a) Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code.
    
    (1) Cannot search index 0
    (2) Return the first index of 0 instead of the last
    (3) Also count 0 as positive number
    (4) Cannot % negative integer

#### (b) If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.

    (1) x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2] y = 2
    (2) x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 0]
    (3) x = [-2, 3, 1, -5, 2]
    (4) x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

#### (c) If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.

#### (d) If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Donâ€™t forget about the program counter.(e) For the given test case, describe the first error state. Be sure to describe the complete state.

#### (f) Implement your repair and verify that the given test now produces the expected output. Submit a screen printout or other evidence that your new program works.
