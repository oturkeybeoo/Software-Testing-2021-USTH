## Answer questions aâ€“g for the graph defined by the following sets:
* N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
* N0 = {1}
* Nf = {7}
* E = {(1, 2), (1, 7), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 2), (4, 5),(4, 6), (5, 6), (6, 1)}
### Also consider the following (candidate) test paths:
* p1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]
* p2 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 7]
* p3 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]

#### (a) Draw the graph.

#### (b) List the test requirements for Edge-Pair Coverage. (Hint: You should get 12 requirements of length 2.)

#### (c) Does the given set of test paths satisfy Edge-Pair Coverage? If not, state what is missing.

#### (d) Consider the simple path [3, 2, 4, 5, 6] and test path [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 7]. Does the test path tour the simple path directly? With a side-trip? If so, write down the side-trip.

#### (e) List the test requirements for Node Coverage, Edge Coverage, and Prime Path Coverage on the graph.

#### (f) List test paths from the given set that achieve Node Coverage but not Edge Coverage on the graph.

#### (g) List test paths from the given set that achieve Edge Coverage but not Prime Path Coverage on the graph.
