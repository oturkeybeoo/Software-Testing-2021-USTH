## Return to the example at the beginning of the chapter of the two characteristics “File F sorted ascending” and “File F sorted descending.” Each characteristic has two blocks. Give test case values for all four combinations of these two characteristics.

    Test for (Ascending.True, Descending.True) = [1]
    Test for (Ascending.True, Descending.False) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Test for (Ascending.False, Descending.True) = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    Test for (Ascending.False, Descending.False) = [3, 2, 5, 1, 4]
