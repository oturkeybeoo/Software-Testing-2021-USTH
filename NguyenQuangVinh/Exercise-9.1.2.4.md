## Consider the following BNF:
A ::= O B | O M | O B M
O ::= "w" | "x" | "s" | "m"
B ::= "i" | "f" | "c" | "r"
M ::= "o" | "t" | "p" | "a" | "h"

#### (a) How many nonterminal symbols are in the grammar?

#### (b) How many terminal symbols are in the grammar?

#### (c) Write two strings that are valid according to the BNF.

#### (d) For each of your two strings, give two valid mutants of the string.

#### (e) For each of your two strings, give two invalid mutants of the string.
